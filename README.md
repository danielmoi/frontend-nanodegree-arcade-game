Frogger Arcade Game
===============================

Welcome to my Frontend Nanodegree Arcade Game Clone!

This game is a basic clone of the classic Frogger arcade game.

**Goal:** Move the heroine from the bottom of the board to the river at the top of the board!

**Game play:**

1. Game starts automatically.
2. Avoid getting hit by the enemy bugs! 
3. Game will restart automatically after a collision with a bug, and after reaching the river.

**Controls:**
Use the 4 arrow keys (Left, Right, Up, Down)

**Let's Go!** â€“ You can access my game here: http://danielmoi.com/arcade

I hope you like my game clone, and enjoying playing it!
